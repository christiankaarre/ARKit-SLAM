# VisualTrajectory
This project is created to test the visual-inertial odometry of ARKit. The testing includes two parts: visualizing the device's trajectory with augmented reality and saving the relative coordinates (3DoF) of the device into a .txt-file. 


## Tested on

* iPhone X with iOS 13.3 and ARKit 2.0
* iPad (5th Gen) with iOS 13.3 and ARKit 2.0
